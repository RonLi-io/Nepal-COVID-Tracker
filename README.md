# Nepal-COVID-Tracker
**COVID-19 Tracker** is an initiative by [RonLi](https://www.ronli.io) to help people track the crisis of COVID-19 in Nepal. This project uses PHP and other JS libraries to create a [beautiful UI](https://www.ronli.io/F1/COVID-19/np/) for the tracker which renders data from wiki page "[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Nepal)".



# Quick Setup
Clone the repo and hit **./fetchJSON.php** file, it will fetch->parse->*alter** the data and finally saves it inside **assets/** folder with the name **response.json**.  You are done here, try loading **./index.php** in your browser.
> **Alter the data to make it parsable by JS Libraries;*
